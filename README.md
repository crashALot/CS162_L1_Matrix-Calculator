# CS162_L1_Matrix-Calculator
A review covering the concept of pointers, and multi-dimensional dynamic arrays. This program incorporates my beginning attempts with makefiles too. For most programs with a CS162 title input validation also begins to get incorporated with most code (getchar() is a great thing). This program asks the users to choose the size of the a (2x2 or 3x3) matrix, dynamically allocates the memory space for the matrix, prompts the user to enter 4 or 9 integers to fill the matrix, and calculates the determinant. Afterwards the program displays both the matrix and the determinant to the user.
